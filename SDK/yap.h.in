/// Functions provided in this header and in yap.dll DO NOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN PACKED!
/// Every function is handled internally by the packer, meaning you do not need to distribute yap.dll with your application, because it doesn't do anything.
/// Please make sure that you link with yap.dll specifically, and do not rename it, otherwise the packer will not be able to resolve the imports!
/// All functions are provided if they were imported, regardless of configuration options when packing.
/// You also cannot use GetProcAddress to get access to these functions.
/// 
/// You don't have to link with yap.dll if you only use reasm macros.

/// Have a good day :)
